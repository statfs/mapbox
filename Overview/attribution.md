You must include the the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice on any map that uses the Mapbox Maps SDK for Unity. We provide an `Attribution` prefab that includes all required information and can be customized via uGUI.

You may adjust the position of the Mapbox wordmark and attribution notice, but they must remain visible on the map. You may also change the background and text color of the attribution notice to best match your design aesthetics, but all information must be clearly legible.

You may not otherwise alter the Mapbox wordmark or text attribution notice. If you wish to otherwise relocate or to remove the Mapbox wordmark, please [contact our sales team](https://www.mapbox.com/contact/sales/) to discuss options available under our Enterprise plans.
